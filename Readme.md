<h2 align="center">Terms of service</h2><br>


1. XeRi-Coins ("XRQ's") are earned by miners with a process called mining.<br/>
2. Mining is described as using ???????? algorithm , in which finding a correct result to a mathematical problem gives the miner a reward.<br/>
3. Mining can be officially done using CPUs, AVR boards (e.g. Arduino boards), Single-board computers (e.g. Raspberry Pi boards), ESP32/8266 boards with the usage of official miners (other officially allowed miners are described in the upper part of README).<br/>
4. Mining on GPUs, FPGAs and other high-efficiency hardware is allowed, but using only the `EXTREME` mining difficulty.<br/>
5. Any users using miners on difficulty not suited for their hardware will be automatically throttled and/or blocked.<br/>
6. Any users spotted using inappropriate and/or overpowered hardware will be banned manually or automatically from the network without prior notice.<br/>
7. Banning involves blocking the user from accessing his coins along with the removal of an account.<br/>
8. Only coins earned legally are eligible for the exchange.<br/>
9. Users spotted using a VPN (or similar) with malicious intents (e.g. bypassing limits) may be banned without prior notice.<br/>
10. Multiple accounts used to bypass limits may be banned without prior notice.<br/>
11. Accounts may be suspended temporarily to investigate ("investigations") ToS violations ("violation" or "abuse").<br/>
12. Multiple accounts used to evade bans will be banned without prior notice.<br/>
13. An exchange request made to the offical XRQ-Exchange ("the offical exchange") may be delayed and/or declined during investigations. <br/>
14. Exchange requests made to the offical exchange may be declined due to ToS violations and/or low funding.<br/>
15. A user's XRQ's may be burnt if a violation can be proven.<br/>
16. These terms of service can change at any time without prior notice.<br/>
17. Every user using XeRi-Coin agrees to comply with the above rules.<br/>

1. On the master server we only store usernames, hashed passwords (with the help of bcrypt) and e-mails of users as their account data.<br/>
2. E-mails are not publicly available and are only used for contacting user when needed, confirming exchanges on the XRQ-Exchange and receiving an occasional newsletter (planned for the future).<br/>
3. Balances, transactions and mining-related data is publicly available in the public</a>.<br/>
4. The privacy policy may be changed in the future with a prior notification.
